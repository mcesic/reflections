When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?
If I want to collaborate with other people on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Githubautomatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case someone else is also working on a project, conflicts in source code could happen which need to be addressed manually.
