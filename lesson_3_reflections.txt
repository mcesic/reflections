When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?
If I want to collaborate with other people on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Githubautomatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case someone else is also working on a project, conflicts in source code could happen which need to be addressed manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone command copies contents of a repository to a local machine. Fork is similar to clone, with difference that it works on Github server. Branch is basically a group of commits logically separated from other branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can merge files and solve conflicts.
