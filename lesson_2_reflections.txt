What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git init creates new subdirectory named .git that contains necessary repository files. At this point, nothing in project is tracket yet.

How is staging area different from the working area and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is used for tracking files which will be included in our next commit. It offers flexibility in choosing which files will be included in future commit.
